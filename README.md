# Lighter DEX Market Maker

This project is a complete market making solution for the Lighter DEX, built in Python. It consists of three main components that work together to collect data, calculate optimal trading parameters, and execute a market making strategy.
Works on PAXG now by default. Check `CRYPTO_CONFIGURATION.md` to see what parts to change to switch to another market.

The three core components are:
1.  **Data Collector (`gather_lighter_data.py`)**: Connects to the Lighter DEX websocket to stream real-time order book and trade data, saving it to CSV files.
2.  **Parameter Calculator (`calculate_avellaneda_parameters.py`)**: Implements the Avellaneda-Stoikov model to calculate optimal bid/ask spreads and reservation prices based on the collected data.
3.  **Market Maker (`market_maker.py`)**: Executes the market making strategy by placing and managing orders on the Lighter exchange, using the parameters generated by the calculator.

The entire system is orchestrated using Docker Compose, making it easy to run and manage.

Important Tips:
- Use on a dedicated account or sub-account. The bot will try to use all the funds available, and do compound interests.
- Only use the Market Making with PAXG, many things have to be modified to run for another Crypto, including order size and price input formats
- You don't need to have the `.env` file to run the data collector service
- Run first, for 1-2 days, the data collector service only, by edtiting the `docker-compose.yml`  (comment out the market maker service)
- To get your `ACCOUNT_INDEX`, you can go to\
   `https://mainnet.zklighter.elliot.ai/api/v1/accountsByL1Address?l1_address=0xcEd...` where `0xcEd...` is your L1 (EVM) wallet address (Metamask, Rabby, Ledger, ...)
- Freshly coded, probably some bugs, only run with small amount of funds

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
*   Docker
*   Docker Compose

### Configuration

1.  **Create `.env` file:** Create a `.env` file in the root of the project. See `.env.example` for a template.

    ```env
    # Lighter Exchange Credentials
    API_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY=<your_api_key_private_key>
    ACCOUNT_INDEX=<your_account_index>
    API_KEY_INDEX=<your_api_key_index>

    # Market Maker Behavior
    MARKET_SYMBOL=PAXG
    ```

2.  **Environment Variables:**
    *   `API_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY`, `ACCOUNT_INDEX`, `API_KEY_INDEX`: Your Lighter exchange credentials.
    *   `MARKET_SYMBOL`: The market to trade on (e.g., PAXG, BTC, ETH). Defaults to `PAXG`.
    *   `CLOSE_LONG_ON_STARTUP`: (true/false) If true, the bot will attempt to close any existing long position in the specified market on startup. Defaults to `false`.
    *   `REQUIRE_PARAMS`: (true/false) If true, the market maker will *not* place any orders until valid Avellaneda parameters are calculated. If false, it will use a static fallback spread. Defaults to `false`.
    *   `RESTART_INTERVAL_MINUTES`: The market maker service will automatically restart after this many minutes. This helps in reloading parameters and preventing potential memory leaks. Defaults to `5`.

You can obtain the API credentials from the Lighter exchange.

### Running the Bot

Start all services using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start the data collector, parameter calculator, and market maker in the background.

### Stopping the Bot

To stop all services, run:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Example Output

Here is an example of the market maker logs in action:

## How it Works

### 1. Data Collection

The `gather_lighter_data.py` script connects to the Lighter DEX websocket and subscribes to the order book and trade channels for the configured markets (e.g., 'ETH', 'BTC', 'PAXG', 'ASTER'). It saves this data to CSV files in the `lighter_data` directory.

### 2. Parameter Calculation

The `calculate_avellaneda_parameters.py` script is set to run every 2 hours by default (defined in `docker-compose.yml`). Each time it runs, it analyzes the last 4 hours of trade and order book data to calculate the parameters for the Avellaneda-Stoikov market making model.

A key input to this model is market volatility (sigma). The script now calculates this using the **GARCH(1,1) model**, which provides a more sophisticated and responsive measure of volatility. If the GARCH model fails to produce a value, or if there are fewer than 10 historical data periods available, the script automatically **falls back to a rolling standard deviation** of log returns to ensure robustness.

The calculated parameters, including the volatility and optimal spreads, are saved to a nicely formatted JSON file (e.g., `avellaneda_parameters_PAXG.json`) in the `params` directory. It needs at least 1-2 days of gathered data to work properly.

### 3. Market Making

The `market_maker.py` script reads the parameters from the JSON file generated by the calculator. It then connects to the Lighter exchange and places buy and sell orders based on the calculated optimal spreads and reservation prices. It continuously monitors the market and its own orders, adjusting them as needed.
